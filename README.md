# qm
A component library for React &amp; Vue. Designed to be simple & accessible, with convenient styling defaults

> This component library is designed for personal use and is very much a work-in-progress. The packages are not publicly available at this time. I plan to continue to port components from [Toolbox](https://github.com/n-grubb/toolbox) over here and build out this library as I have time.

## Goals
- **Simply semantic**: Most component libraries are designed to handle every use case (which is great!) but the html output tends to turn into a bowl of <div> soup. This component library is different: it is designed to generate semantic html and takes advantage of advanced CSS techniques to keep the markdown lean.
- **Accessible**: Components will be developed with accessibility in mind and feature convenient defaults and properties around a11y. 
- **Convenient Default Styles**: Included in this project is a CSS system that takes advantage of CSS Custom Properties to create convenient defaults that are easily overwritten by a theme system. This is an opinionated use that takes some inspiration from Tailwind's design tokens without the utility-first approach.

### FAQ

#### Why React _AND_ Vue?
Purely for my own entertainment. Rather than focusing on one I want to keep my skills sharp in both frameworks and sometimes grab different tools for different uses. I want this project to support both ecosystems.

#### Why "qm"?
qm stands for Quartermaster as I envision this project being something I can use to provision future personal applications for success. I created a WordPress theming system under the same name so it's a continuation of the same "brand".
